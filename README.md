# Jams!

Jams is a music app written for Android. The project was begun for a Mobile Application Development class.

## Current Features
* Filter music by artist, album, or song
* Play a selected song
* Pause and play the current song at any time via notification bar
* Skip to next song or previous song at any time via notification bar
* Current song will pause if another app requests audio control
    * Song will resume once control is relinquished
* Albums will repeat on completion, as will all songs
    * No, you can't turn this off as of yet. It's a feature. :)

## In the Works
### These features will be implemented in the future:
* Audio scrubbing
* Ability to create and modify playlists
* Songs in an album will be sorted in the way the artist intended rather than alphabetically
* Toggle shuffle play for an artist, album, playlist, or all songs
* Toggle repeat for an artist, album, playlist, or song
* Improved UI functionality and design
* More to come
